# CSCI 2270 Data Structures - Assignment 9: Graph Part II

## Objectives

1. Applications of the Depth First Traversal
2. Getting comfortable with double pointers.

## Instructions

Please find the file: `Assignment 9.pdf`

Write code to apply the Depth First Traversal. To receive credit for your code, you will need to pass the necessary test cases. Use the following steps to test your code as you work on the assignment:

 1. Open up your Linux terminal, navigate to the build directory of this assignment (e.g. `cd build`).
 2. Run the `cmake ..` command.
 3. Run the `make` command.
 4. If there are no compilation errors, two executables will be generated within the build directory: `run_app_1` and `run_tests`.
 5. If you would like to run your program including your app implementation in the `main` function, execute `run_app_1` from the terminal by typing `./run_app_1`.
 6. To run the grading tests, execute `run_tests` from the terminal by typing `./run_tests`. 

**NOTE: You are welcome to use the *main* function to test your code. The code in *main_1.cpp* is not being graded for this assignment.**
