# CSCI 2270 â€“ Data Structures - Assignment 5 - Stacks and Queues

## Objectives

1. Implement a stack using a Linked List
2. Implement a queue using an array

## Instructions

Write code to complete Parts 1 and 2. Implement the solution for each part as a separate program. To receive credit for your code, you will need to pass the necessary test cases. Use the following steps to test your code as you work on the assignment:

 1. Open up your Linux terminal, navigate to the build directory of this assignment (e.g. `cd build`).
 2. Run the `cmake ..` command.
 3. Run the `make` command.
 4. If there are no compilation errors, three executables will be generated within the build directory: `run_app_1`, `run_app_2`, and `run_tests`.
 5. If you would like to run your program including your app implementation in the `main` function, execute `run_app_1` from the terminal by typing `./run_app_1`. Similarly, you can execute `run_app_2`.
 6. To run the grading tests, execute `run_tests` from the terminal by typing `./run_tests`.
