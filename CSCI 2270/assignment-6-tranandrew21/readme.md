# CSCI 2270 – Data Structures - Assignment 6: Binary Search Tree

## Instructions

Please read all the directions ​*before* writing code, as this write-up contains specific requirements for how the code should be written.

To receive credit for your code, you will need to pass the necessary test cases. Use the following steps to test your code as you work on the assignment:

 1. Open up your Linux terminal, navigate to the build directory of this assignment (e.g. `cd build`).
 2. Run the `cmake ..` command.
 3. Run the `make` command.
 4. If there are no compilation errors, two executables will be generated within the build directory: `run_app_1` and `run_tests`.
 4. If you would like to run your program, execute `run_app_1` from the terminal by typing `./run_app_1 <Required argument>`.
 5. To run the grading tests, execute `run_tests` from the terminal by typing `./run_tests`.
