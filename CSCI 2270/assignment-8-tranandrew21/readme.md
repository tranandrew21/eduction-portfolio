# CSCI 2270 â€“ Data Structures - Assignment 8: Graph Part I

## Objectives

1. Applications of the Breadth First Traversal

## Instructions

Write code to apply the Breadth First Traversal. To receive credit for your code, you will need to pass the necessary test cases. Use the following steps to test your code as you work on the assignment:

 1. Open up your Linux terminal, navigate to the build directory of this assignment (e.g. `cd build`).
 2. Run the `cmake ..` command.
 3. Run the `make` command.
 4. If there are no compilation errors, two executables will be generated within the build directory: `run_app_1` and `run_tests`.
 5. If you would like to run your program including your app implementation in the `main` function, execute `run_app_1` from the terminal by typing `./run_app_1`.
 6. To run the grading tests, execute `run_tests` from the terminal by typing `./run_tests`. 

## Overview

In this assignment, you will apply BFT for finding distances between connected vertices in a graph.

The graph will be implemented using the following struct: 

```
struct vertex;
struct adjVertex{
    vertex *v;
};

struct vertex{

    string name;
    bool visited = false;
    int distance = 0;
    vector<adjVertex> adj;

};
```

**NOTE: You are welcome to use the *main* function to test your code. The code in *main_1.cpp* is not being graded for this assignment.**

## Class Specifications

The **Graph** class definition is provided in the file `Graph.hpp`. Do not modify this file! Fill in the TODO implementations in file `Graph.cpp` according to the following specifications. 

**void addVertex(string name);** 
+ Add new vertex `name` to the graph.

**void addEdge(string v1, string v2);** 
+ Add an edge between vertices named `v1` and `v2`.

**void displayEdges();** 
+ Display all the edges in the graph in the following format:

If we create a graph with the following structure.

```
graph.addVertex("Chicago");
graph.addVertex("NYC");
graph.addVertex("Boston");

graph.addEdge("Chicago", "Boston");
graph.addEdge("NYC", "Boston");
```

We print the edges in the following manner.

```
Chicago --> Boston
Boston --> NYC Chicago
NYC --> Boston
```

The order of vertices printed is the same as the order in which they were added to the graph. Similarly, the order of vertices to the right of `-->` sign is the same as the order in which the
corresponding edge was added to the graph.

**void breadthFirstTraverse(string sourceVertex);**
+ Breadth first traversal from `sourceVertex`. Format for printing:

```
// for the source vertex in the graph
cout<< "Starting vertex (root): " << vStart->name << "->";
// for other vertex traversed from source vertex with distance
cout << n->adj[x].v->name <<"("<< n->adj[x].v->distance <<")"<< " ";
```

**int findReachableCitiesWithinDistanceK(string source, int k);**
+ Imagine that you are in some city (i.e. the source vertex) and your fuel allows you to go a maximum distance of  `k`.  You decide that you want to use up the entire fuel to reach a city and stay the night. However, you want to be as efficient as possible; therefore, you will take the *shortest path* to the destination city. In this context, this method will provide the vector of all cities reachable (i.e. is at a minimum distance of `k`) from the `source` city.
  
Considering the following city graphs, we have **A** as the `source` city, coloured in *blue*, and the reachable cities coloured in *red*.
