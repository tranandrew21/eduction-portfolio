# CSCI 2270 â€“ Data Structures - Assignment 2: Array doubling with dynamic memory

## Objectives

1. Read a file with unknown size and store its contents in a dynamic array
2. Store, search and iterate through data in an array of structs
3. Use array doubling via dynamic memory to increase the size of the array

## Instructions

Write a program to analyse the word frequency in a document. Because the number of words in the document may not be known a priori, implement a **dynamically doubling array** to store the necessary information. 

Please read all the directions *before* writing code, as this write-up contains specific
requirements for how the code should be written.

To receive credit for your code, you will need to pass the necessary test cases. Use the following steps to test your code as you work on the assignment:

 1. Open up your Linux terminal, navigate to the build directory of this assignment (e.g. `cd build`).
 2. Run the `cmake ..` command.
 3. Run the `make` command.
 4. If there are no compilation errors, two executables will be generated within the build directory: `run_app_1` and `run_tests`.
 4. If you would like to run your program including your app implementation in the `main` function, execute `run_app_1` from the terminal by typing `./run_app_1 <Required arguments>`.
 5. To run the grading tests, execute `run_tests` from the terminal by typing `./run_tests`.

### 8. Submitting your code:
Write your code and push the changes to your private repository. Log onto Canvas and go to Assignment 2. Paste your GitHub repository link and submit.
