# CSCI 2270 â€“ Data Structures - Assignment 3:  Linked Lists 

## Objectives

1. Create, traverse, add nodes to a linked list
2. Get practice implementing classes

## Instructions

You will be implementing a class to simulate a linked list of shows. To receive credit for your code, you will need to pass the necessary test cases. Use the following steps to test your code as you work on the assignment:

 1. Open up your Linux terminal, navigate to the build directory of this assignment (e.g. `cd build`).
 2. Run the `cmake ..` command.
 3. Run the `make` command.
 4. If there are no compilation errors, two executables will be generated within the build directory: `run_app_1`, and `run_tests`.
 5. If you would like to run your program including your app implementation in the `main` function, execute `run_app_1` from the terminal by typing `./run_app_1`.
 6. To run the grading tests, execute `run_tests` from the terminal by typing `./run_tests`. 

 **NOTE: Make sure to run your program `./run_app_1` WITHOUT command line arguments.**
